Discover how the Object Mother concept empowers developers to effortlessly generate intricate test objects, 
enhancing code readability, maintainability, and overall testing efficiency.

## The creational problem
A good structured test exists out of three parts commonly known as: Given When Then or Arrange Act Assert.

Within the _Given_ part you declare a set of objects that will drive your test. 
Initially the creational logic is simple, as the objects may have fewer fields or lack coherence.
However, inevitably over time, the set of objects grows as their intricacy, they become more complex and 
time-consuming to construct.

Various solutions exist to address those issues, such as _Test Data Factories_, _Data Fakers_, 
_Test Data Generators_ or _Fixture Builders_ etc ..
In the end they all share a common goal: <b style="color: #3da6b1;">simplifying</b> object creation while ensuring <b style="color: #3da6b1;">reusability</b>. 
Martin Fowler has even coined a term for this concept, known as 
[Object Mother](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html).

Let's delve deeper into the problem by examining a concrete example. While this example may not be overly complex or 
entirely realistic, the purpose of this article is to work with practical scenarios without getting bogged down in the 
intricacies of object creation.
```java
Address billingAddress = new Address.Builder()
        .streetAddress("123 Main St")
        .city("Anytown")
        .state("CA")
        .zipCode("12345")
        .country(Country.US)
        .build();
Address shippingAddress = new Address.Builder()
        .streetAddress("456 Oak Ave")
        .city("Othertown")
        .state("CA")
        .zipCode("67890")
        .country(Country.US)
        .build();
List<InvoiceItem> items = new ArrayList<>();
items.add(new InvoiceItem("Product A", Amount.EUR(100.00), Tax.vatPercentage(21)));
items.add(new InvoiceItem("Product B", Amount.EUR(100.00), Tax.vatPercentage(21)));
Customer customer = new Customer.Builder()
        .name("John Doe")
        .email("john.doe@example.com")
        .phoneNumber("555-123-4567")
        .build();
Invoice invoice = new Invoice(
        new InvoiceNumber("001"),
        customer,
        billingAddressm,
        shippingAddress,
        LocalDate.now(),
        items);

Amount amount = invoice.getVatAmount();

assertThat(amount).isEqualTo(Amount.EUR(42))
```

In the case of the aforementioned test, an Invoice object is needed, which, in turn, depends on several other objects. 
However, it is noteworthy that, for this specific test, <b style="color: #3da6b1;">only the invoice items hold significance</b>. They play a vital role
in asserting and calculating the VAT amount, all the other objects and fields just <b style="color: #3da6b1;">clutter the readability of the test</b>.

## Test Data - Factory, Generator, Builder, Fixtures ...

There are numerous patterns available to create the required objects for your tests.
A very common approach to simplify the creational logic while at the same time having some kind of of code reuse in place 
is to create __static factory methods__ returning the required objects.

```java
InvoiceTestDataFactory.invoice();
```

While this approach may initially appear to solve the creational issue, it tends to scale poorly
As [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html) highlights:
> Object Mothers do have their faults. In particular there's a heavy coupling in that many tests will depend on the exact data in the mothers.

I've observed several solutions to address this issue, including;
- creating specific static factory methods
- adding parameters to differentiate the creational logic.

```java
InvoiceTestDataFactory.invoiceWithoutShippingAddress();
InvoiceTestDataFactory.invoiceWithoutBillingAddressAndThreeItems();
InvoiceTestDataFactory.invoice(new InvoiceNumber("001"), "john@doe,com");
InvoiceTestDataFactory.invoice(
        new InvoiceItem("Product A", Amount.EUR(100.00), Tax.vatPercentage(21)), 
        new InvoiceItem("Product B", Amount.EUR(100.00), Tax.vatPercentage(21)));
```

While these solutions may initially appear to solve the coupling issue, they often result in tight coupling between 
specific factory methods and the requirements of individual tests, limiting their reusability.

One introduces _different_ factory methods or several sets of parameters because there are tests that require _different_ 
_permutations_ of the same objects under test.

Imagine you have an object with 5 primitive fields and 5 custom-typed fields. The question arises: how many permutations
of factory methods or parameter sets would be required to cover all your test cases? 

Introducing static factory methods or parameters might make the code challenging to maintain and may not facilitate effective communication within the 
Given part of your tests. Ultimately, pursuing this path leads to test data factories that are difficult to maintain 
and confusing to use.

So, how can we <b style="color: #3da6b1;">simplify the technical creational logic while simultaneously highlighting its essential aspects</b>?

## Emphasize what matters and hide the irrelevant parts 

By combining the Object Mother concept with <b style="color: #3da6b1;">pre-filled builders</b> it becomes possible to hide away all unnecessary 
complexity while at the same time <b style="color: #3da6b1;">emphasizing what matters</b> for your test-case.


Let's put this into practice using the previous example:

```java
Invoice invoice = InvoiceMother.invoice()
        .withInvoiceItems(
            new InvoiceItem("Product A", Amount.EUR(100.00), Tax.vatPercentage(21)),
            new InvoiceItem("Product B", Amount.EUR(100.00), Tax.vatPercentage(21)))
        .build();

Amount amount = invoice.getVatAmount();

assertThat(amount).isEqualTo(Amount.EUR(42))
```

üëâÔ∏è It's important to <b style="color: #3da6b1;">stress the prefilled nature of a mother.</b>
Calling `InvoiceMother.invoice().build()` will return a fully fledged `Invoice` were all fields are filled
in containing <b style="color: #3da6b1;">sensible default values</b>.

By utilizing the approach mentioned above, the unnecessary clutter is eliminated, allowing the focus to be solely on 
what is essential for the test. In this particular case, it becomes evident that having two invoice items priced at 
EUR 100 each, with a 21% tax applied to each item, results in EUR 42 of taxes

We are still using some kind of _static factory method,_ yet it does not immediately return our Invoice rather it returns
a <b style="color: #3da6b1;">builder</b> that allows you to override those defaults <b style="color: #3da6b1;">that matter for your specific test</b>.

I like to make the builder part of the Mother class as to reduce the chance to confuse it with production
code InvoiceBuilders.

```java
public class InvoiceMother {
    
    private InvoiceMother() { }
    
    public static Builder invoice() {
        return new Builder();
    }
    
    public static class Builder {

        InvoiceNumber invoiceNumber = new InvoiceNumber("001");
        Customer customer = CustomerMother.customer().build();
        Address billingAddress = AddressMother.address().build();
        Address shippingAddress = AddressMother.address().build();
        LocalDate creationDate = LocalDate.now();
        List<InvoiceItem> items = List.of(InvoiceItemMother.item().build());
        
        public Builder withItems(List<InvoiceItem> items) {
            this.items = items;
            return this;
        }
        
        // other setters are left out for brevity
        
        public Invoice build() {
            return new Invoice(
                    invoiceNumber,
                    customer,
                    billingAddressm,
                    shippingAddress,
                    creationDate,
                    items);
        }
    }
}
```

It's important to note that the concept discussed here is not about the suffix 'Mother.'
If you find the suffix unfavorable, feel free to use any other suffix that better suits your needs, such as
_InvoiceTestDataFactory,_ _InvoiceFixture,_ _InvoiceTestData,_ and so on.

What is important:

- Let your factory methods return *Builders* not the object under creation.
- Use a <b style="color: #3da6b1;">pre-filled Builder</b>
- <b style="color: #3da6b1;">Limit</b> your <b style="color: #3da6b1;">static factory methods</b> to the absolute minimum.
- Rather <b style="color: #3da6b1;">override a field using the Builder</b> than to introduce a new static factory method.

What can flex:

- Let the defaults for custom complex objects depend on other Mothers
- The Mother suffix
- Making the Builder part of your Mother class

But what if your test requires a specific field in one of the nested custom objects to be in a particular state? 
For instance, you may need the shipping address's country to be set as 'US,' while the other field values are irrelevant
for your test. 
With the current setup, you would have to pass in another mother object and build it fully changing only that field that 
matter for your test.

```java
InvoiceMother.invoice()
    .withShippingAddress(AddressMother.address()
        .withCountry(Country.US)
        .build())
    .build();
```

Although this approach works, we can further improve it by utilizing a `java.util.function.Consumer` with 
the `AddressMother.Builder`:

```java
InvoiceMother.invoice()
        .withShippingAddress(b -> b.withCountry(Country.US))
        .build();
```

In this case, the builder method would look like this:

```java
public Builder withShippingAddress(Consumer<AddressMother.Builder> addressConsumer) {
    Address.Builder builder = AddressMother.address();
    addressConsumer.accept(builder)
    this.shippingAddress = builder.build();    
    return this;
}
```

These enhancements aim to improve the readability and clarity of the code example while retaining the original meaning 
and intent.

## Takeaways

In conclusion, the Object Mother concept offers developers a powerful approach to effortlessly generate intricate 
test objects. By combining the concept with pre-filled builders, developers can effectively simplify the technical 
creational logic while emphasizing the essential aspects of their test cases.

By embracing the Object Mother concept and its principles, developers can achieve enhanced code readability, 
maintainability, and overall testing efficiency in their software projects. This becomes particularly crucial in complex
projects, as tests serve not only to verify code correctness and guide design but also to serve as documentation and 
prevention of regression. When regression does occur, it is vital for both your future self and colleagues to clearly 
understand what is being tested.
